In the realm of music, can melodies ever truly <perish>?
Do we fear the idea of our existence <perishing> away?
Amidst the ruins, ancient civilizations slowly <perish> into obscurity.
Will the delicate flower <perish> without water and sunlight?
The fragile hope seemed to <perish> with each passing day.
Does wisdom <perish> with age, or does it grow stronger?
As the flames engulfed the forest, life began to <perish>.
In the harsh desert, even the toughest plants eventually <perish>.
